# Circuit - Navigation and State Management Demo

This project demonstrates navigation and state management in an Android application using the
[Circuit](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) framework developed by Slack.

[Circuit](https://github.com/slackhq/circuit) is a framework for building composable UI in Kotlin.
It provides a declarative way to define UI components and manage their state.

## Architecture

- Implements Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture.
- Utilizes Circuit's `Navigator` and `BackStack` components for screen transitions and navigation
  flow
- Leverages Circuit's state management capabilities for UI state changes and data updates
- Integrates with Jetpack Compose for building a modern, responsive UI

## Circuit Framework

- **Navigation:** Circuit's `Navigator` and `BackStack` components are used to manage screen
  transitions and navigation flow.
- **State Management:** Circuit's state management capabilities are used to handle UI state changes
  and data updates.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- **ui:** Contains composable functions for the UI elements.
- **data:** Contains data models and repositories.
- **navigation:** Contains navigation-related components, such as the `Navigator` and `BackStack`.
- **state:** Contains state management logic and data holders.
